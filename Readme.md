Install dependencies using npm i

Install nodemon globally if you don't already have it

Install PostgreSQL & run it (requires the password you created during installation). Also i`ve used this programm - 'pgAdmin 4'(install with PostgreSQL)

Add database access credentials to db.js - recommend installing npm dotenv & using .env to hide credentials if commiting to Github
